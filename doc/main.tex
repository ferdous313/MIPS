\section{Overall structure}

\subsection{Requirements}
The entire system is based on a simplified MIPS architecture. Register file contains 32 registers, with 1KBytes of instruction memory and 32Bytes of data memory.\\

Two types of hazard handling shall be implemented: data hazard and control hazard.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data hazard} uses {\sc forwarding unit} to reduce or avoid the stall cycles, but forwarding to {\sc ID} stage isn't necessary. 
\item \textbf{Control hazard} should contain pipeline flush, and let the instructions follow by beq or j instruction to stall for 1 cycle if necessary.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coding guideline}

\subsection{Instruction fetch}
For program counter multiplexer, there are four ways to go. The first is to add 4 to current address, which is to fetch the next line. The second is to add immediate of branch instructions if specific condition was met. The third is the jump instrction. And the last one is stall.
\subsection{Instruction decode}
\subsubsection{Instruction set}
There are 10 instructions we have to implement, they are grouped into their respective types below. 

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|}
	\hline
    Instruction & Type & Op & Func\\
    \hline
    and & ? & 000000 & 100100 \\
    or & ? & 000000 & 100101 \\
    add & ? & 000000 & 100000 \\
    sub & ? & 000000 & 100010 \\
    mul & ? & 000000 & 011000 \\
    lw & ? & 100011 & - \\
    sw & ? & 101011 & - \\
    beq & ? & 000100 & - \\
    j & ? & 000010 & - \\
    addi & ? & 001000 & - \\
    \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: Since the TAs require us to test the result using the program provided, which also limits the way how OpCodes are assigned.\\

\subsubsection{Instruction format}

\subsection{Execution}
The main purpose of this section is to prepare all the data needed for ALU, and execute them. The data are either from register or forwarding from EX/MEM gate or MEM/WB gate. Forwarding unit are the signals controller of picking the data. Noticed that data could be stalled if special signal are received.
